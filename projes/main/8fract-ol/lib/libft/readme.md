# myLibft
This an expanded version of the "original" Libft Project from the 42-Core_Curriculum.

## Libft
This is the first project from the 42 core curriculum. The task is to create a own C library with some highly useful standard functions.

**This library will not be 'finished', it'll expand with further projects.**

## Project
### Mandatory
**Part 1:**
* re-code a set of the libc functions, as they are defined in the ```man```
* your functions will need to present the same prototype and behaviors as the originals

**Part 2:**
* implement some other special helpful functions

### Bonus
* implement some functions that are useful for working with linked lists

## How to use it:
To use this library for your code just follow these 3 steps.

**1. Make the library**
```
make
```
**2. Include the Headerfile in your ```.c``` files**
```c
#include "path_to_libft/libft.h"
```
**3. Compile your srcs with the library**
```
gcc your-srcs.c path_to_libft/libft.a
```
