cp - copy

ln - link

mkdir - make directory

rm - remove (as in delete)

ld - load (link files for a loadable program) - this is a correction

su - Switch User (as in become the admin dude if you donâ€™t select a userID )

ls - list files

ed - a line (text) editor

vi - a visual (24x80 terminal display) editor

grep - generate "regular expression" & print //anything that is found//

diff - find the difference in lines between two files //and print them out//

sed - stream editor <<stream in, process with a "regular expression" and output the results>>

sleep - go to sleep <<wait XX seconds>>

read - stop and wait for input from a terminal

man - list off the manual page (documentation) for a command

more (& pg) - list a file a page/line at a time for display

less - (a joke, as in less is more) does the same as pg & more, but also backs up a file, if requested

Seems intuitive to me. ... Then again, you should deal with things like EXCP, EXCPW, WAIT, ...

Well, there are some arcane instructions,

awk - Aho, Weinberger, & Kernighan (a interpreter named after the creators)

yacc - Yet Another Compiler Compiler (compiler creator)

bison - another interpreter (a pun on a Yak, as in an animal) -this is a correction

lex - a lexical analyzer
